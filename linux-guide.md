## Prerequisites

> {tip} This guide assumes you already have a basic understanding of Linux based systems and programs like **vim** for editing files in the command line, since the whole guide will be taking place in the command line.

<a name="server"></a>
#### Linux Server

 * __Type:__ A small stable VPS, a dedicated machine is a bit overkill unless you're already using it for other things as well.
 * __OS:__ Ubuntu LTS or latest, optionally Debian 8
 * __Ram:__ May work on 256 MB, 512MB is recommended. If you plan on having it on just a few servers. Scale up if necessary.
 * __Processor:__ Single core @ 2.60 GHz or higher will work just fine, as above.
 * SSH access to the server.

<a name="software"></a>
#### Software

 * SSH client, i.e. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) connecting and executing commands on the server

<a name="install-requirements"></a>
## Installing Requirements

Start by logging into your server via your SSH client, we will be using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to download, install, and manage things like Gradle and Java so get that first if you don't already have it installed.

    sudo apt install zip unzip
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

<a name="install-java"></a>
### Installing Java

We'll be using Java 10 to run Ava, if you don't already have Java installed, you can install it easily using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/), first check what versions of Java is available.

    sdk list java

Then pick a version you'd like to use, and install it with.

    sdk install java <version>

> {tip} If you already have Java installed using the OpenJDK, you can uninstall that first by using.
```
apt remove java*
apt autoremove
```

<a name="install-gradle"></a>
### Installing Gradle

We'll be using Gradle 4.7 to build and compile Ava, if you don't already have Gradle installed, you can install it easily using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/), first check what versions of Java is available.

    sdk list gradle

Then Gradle itself:

    sdk install gradle <version>

<a name="install-git"></a>
### Installing Git (Optional)

Next we'll install Git to be able to download and update Ava, git will also be used later on if you want to update Ava to the latest version.

Start off by checking if git is already installed, some services that offers Linux servers comes with Git pre-installed, you can check if git is installed by running:

    git --version

If the command is not found you can install git by running

    sudo apt install git

<a name="install-mysql"></a>
## Installing MySQL

> {tip} Ava also supports SQLite, if you want to use the flatfile SQLite database instead, you can skip this step and just tell Ava to use SQLite in the config instead.

We'll need to setup a database that Ava can use. Ava requires a database to store things like custom playlists, aliases, channel and server data, and a lot of other things.

First we need to download MySQL, doing the following:

    sudo apt install mysql-server

Then, go through the basic setup process using:

    sudo mysql_secure_installation

Now, log into your MySQL database as root by typing:  
(It will ask you for your password what you've entered when you installed MySQL on your server.)

    sudo mysql -p

It is time to actually create the database you will be using for your bot. To do this, first choose a good name for it, and type:

    create database dbname;

Now, create a username and a password for your new database. The password should be very secure. Type the following:

    grant all privileges on dbname.* to 'username'@'localhost' identified by "password";

Where you replace:  
  __dbname__ with the name of the database you just created,  
  __username__ with the username you chose  
  __password__ with the password you chose for your user

Then, type:

    flush privileges;

And finally:

    exit;

<a name="install-ava"></a>
## Installing Ava

Next, we'll need to get the jar file to run Ava, you can get a stable version from the [github releases](https://github.com/avaire/avaire/releases), or the [nightly build](https://avairebot.com/nightly-build.zip) from avairebot.com, the zip file gets updated once every 24 at midnight CEST, you can also build your own jar file by getting source code from the AvaIre GitHub repository, to do this you will will need Git to clone down the code.

You'd want to figure out where you want the bot to be downloaded. When you've found the location of your choice, clone the Ava repository into the folder by using the following command.

    git clone https://github.com/avaire/avaire.git
    cd avaire

You have now successfully cloned the AvaIre Git repository, next we'll need to build the jar file from the source code, we can do this by utilizing gradle which we just installed.

    gradle build

If the build finishes with no errors you should be good to go! You can find the generated binary file at `build/libs/AvaIre.jar`.

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration of Ava

Next we'll need to configure Ava so the bot can connect and communicate with users, to generate the `config.yml` file we'll just need to run Ava once, we can do this by running:

    java -jar AvaIre.jar


You can now open the new `config.yml` file in vim, where you'll need to put your Discord Bot Application token in the `bot.token` property. You can find your bot token under your Discord Application dashboard, if you don't have a Discord bot application setup you can create one easily by following these steps.

 1. Start by heading to [discordapp.com/developers/applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), once you're there you can create a new application, you can name it whatever you want and give it a fancy picture and description if you want to, once you're done click **Create App**.
 2. Your application should now have been created, next click on the **Create a Bot User** button, this will convert the application to a bot user application.
 3. Now that you have a user bot application you can get your bot token under the **App Bot User** section.

> {tip} If you want other people to be able to invite the bot you must check the **Public Bot** options under your **App Bot User** application settings, if you don't do that you will be the only one that can invite the bot to servers.

On your bot application dashboard you'll also be able to find your bot client id, we'll need that later to invite the bot so keep onto it.
Now that you're done with that, it's time to fill out the database information, optionally lavalink access, and the client ID's of your bot administrators.

If you want a more in-detail guide and walkover for the [configuration](/docs/{{version}}/configuration) file you can checkout the [Configuration](/docs/{{version}}/configuration) page, all the settings and options are covered in more detail on that page with guides on how to setup each option.

<a name="running-the-bot"></a>
## Running the bot

Congratulations, your AvaIre instance should now be ready to launch!

To start the bot, simply just run the jar file again after editing it with your bot and database details.

    java -jar AvaIre.jar

If the bot runs without any errors, you have had success so far!

> {tip} It is recommend that you run the bot in a separate process to prevent the bot from disconnecting when you disconnect from the machine, screens works pretty well for this.

Now you'll need to invite your bot to your server so you can actually use it, take your bots client id from earlier and pop it into a URL like this without the less than and greater than symbols.

    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<client id>&scope=bot

Just replace the `<client id>` with your actually bot application id, if you don't have your client id you can find it on the [discordapp.com/developers/applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) page, just click on your application, the client ID is at the very top under the **App Details** section.

Go to the URL in a web browser, select your server and hit `Authorize`, your bot should now be on your server.

You can test simple functionality by running the ping command in a text channel that the bot can see. If it answers "Pong!", then congratulations, you have successfully set up AvaIre!

And that's it! You are now ready to start using your very own AvaIre instance!
Keep in mind, if you have further questions or need help, we're around over at our official server, [AvaIre Central](https://discord.gg/gt2FWER)!

On the behalf of the AvaIre team, we hope you enjoy your bot!
